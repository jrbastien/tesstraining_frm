# A Python n-gram calculator design to generate
# training data for Tesseract 3.05. 
#
# Given an arbitrary string, and the value of n
# as the size of the n-gram (int), this code 
# snip will show you the results, sorted from
# most to least frequently occurring n-gram.
#
# The 'sort by value' operation for the dict 
# follows the PEP 265 recommendation.
#
# Installation:
#
# user@host:~$ sudo pip install pyngram
#
